# Better EdPuzzle Skipper
This script will skip EdPuzzle videos by unlocking the video progress bar. This was made because v6k was too lazy to update his own project... it's whatever though, as you can always rely on us :) We guarantee at least 6 months of updates on our projects. The project began in February 2024, and support will continue until at least July.
